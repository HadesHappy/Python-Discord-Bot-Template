This repository is a template that everyone can use for the start of their discord bot.

When I first started creating my discord bot it took me a while to get everything setup and working with cogs and more. I would've been happy if there were any template existing. But there wasn't any existing template. That's why I decided to create my own template to let <b>you</b> guys create your discord bot in an easy way.

Please note that this template is not supposed to be the best template, but a good template to start learning how discord.py works and to make your own bot in a simple way. You're

If you play to use this template to make your own template or bot, please give me credits, it would be greatly appreciated.

## How to setup

To setup the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.py](config.py) file where you can put the needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable              | What it is                                                            |
| ----------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE  | The prefix(es) of your bot                                            |
| YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE   | The token of your bot                                                 |
| APPLICATION_ID        | The application ID of your bot                                        |
| OWNERS                | The user ID of all the bot owners                                     |
| BLACKLIST             | The user ID of all the users who can't use the bot                    |

## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows) or your Command Prompt (Windows).

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have multiple versions of python installed (2.x and 3.x) then you will need to use the following command:
```
python3 bot.py
```
or eventually
```
python3.8 bot.py
```
<br>

If you have just installed python today, then you just need to use the following command:
```
python bot.py
```

## Built With
